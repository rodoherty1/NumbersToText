NumbersToText
=============

Rob's attempt at a Javascript implementation of the NumbersToText kata.

I realise it's a little longwinded - that's probably a hangover from my Java background where the compiler and JVM are expected to make some optimisations to the executing code.

The jasmine functional tests are passing but I haven't created any unit tests for the individual methods.

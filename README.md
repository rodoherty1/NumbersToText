NumbersToText
=============

Rob's attempt at a Javascript implementation of the NumbersToText kata.

I realise it's a little longwinded - that's a hangover from my Java background where the compiler and JVM are expected to make some optimisations to the executing code.

This is still a work-in-progress.
